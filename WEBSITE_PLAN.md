## 5. Tone & Language Guidelines

### 5.1 Voice Principles

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Confident, not arrogant** | State capabilities directly without overselling | "We design financial operating models" not "We're the best at designing..." |
| **Clear, not simplistic** | Accessible to executives, not dumbed down | Avoid jargon walls, but don't avoid technical terms when precise |
| **Direct, not abrupt** | Get to the point with appropriate context | Lead with insight, support with detail |
| **Warm, not casual** | Professional but human | "We partner with..." not "We synergize with..." |

### 5.2 Language Standards

**Use:**
- Active voice
- Concrete nouns and strong verbs
- Specific numbers and outcomes
- "We" for the firm, "you" for the client
- Industry-standard terminology

**Avoid:**
- Marketing superlatives ("world-class," "cutting-edge," "best-in-class")
- Buzzword density ("leverage synergies to drive holistic transformation")
- Passive constructions where active works
- Vague claims without substantiation
- Exclamation points

### 5.3 Consulting-Grade Writing Checklist

```
Before publishing, verify:
──────────────────────────
□ Every claim is substantiated or qualified
□ No hollow superlatives remain
□ Active voice predominates
□ Sentences average 15-25 words
□ Paragraphs are 2-4 sentences
□ Technical terms are used precisely
□ The "so what" is clear
□ A skeptical executive would not roll their eyes
```

### 5.4 Sample Rewrites

**Before (marketing-speak):**
"QFS leverages cutting-edge methodologies to deliver world-class solutions that drive transformational value creation for our esteemed clients."

**After (consulting-grade):**
"QFS applies proven frameworks—adapted to each client's context—to solve specific financial and operational challenges. Our work is measured by outcomes: cost reduced, decisions improved, capabilities built."
